        <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        The artificial Intelligence program of the PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI technology, 
        via teaching programming in open source languages like Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask, and teaching 
        deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.

    <p id="CNC">
        <h1>Cloud Native Computing</h1>
        The Cloud Native computing program prepares th students to program in open source technologies like Linux, Docker,
        Kubernetes, Javascript, Node.JS, React and React Native, while introducing students to development of Microservices
        and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.

    <p id="BCC">
        <h1>Block chain Computing</h1>
        The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains like Ethereum and Hyoerledger (Fabric)
        and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, javaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces
        them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-Service
        (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Intial Coin Offering (ICO) of a crypto-token.

    <p id="IOT">
        <h1>Internet of Things</h1>
        The Internet of Things program introduces the students to open source development technologies like Rust, Embedded
        Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, google assitant, and Kubernetes while making them efficient in developing Microservices for IOT Edge,
        IOT Cloud, and Voice Computing for device control.
